## Data Flow Patterns

### Typical User Registration Flow
1. User submits registration data → P1: User Authentication
2. P1 validates and stores data → D1: Users Database
3. P1 triggers verification email → P7: Notification System
4. P7 sends email → Email Service → User

### Property Booking Flow
1. Guest submits booking request → P3: Booking Processing
2. P3 validates availability → D2: Properties Database
3. P3 creates booking record → D3: Bookings Database
4. P3 initiates payment → P4: Payment Processing
5. P4 processes payment → Payment Gateway
6. P4 confirms payment → D4: Payments Database
7. P3 confirms booking → P7: Notification System
8. P7 notifies all parties → Users

### Review Submission Flow
1. User submits review → P5: Review System
2. P5 validates booking eligibility → D3: Bookings Database
3. P5 stores review → D5: Reviews Database
4. P5 updates property rating → D2: Properties Database
5. P5 notifies recipient → P7: Notification System

## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data flows are encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Password data is hashed before storage
- Payment information is tokenized through payment gateway

### Access Control
- User authentication required for all personal data access
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Validation
- Input validation at all process entry points
- Database constraints and referential integrity
- Business rule validation before data storage

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Property search results caching
- User session data caching
- Frequently accessed data optimization

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization and monitoring
